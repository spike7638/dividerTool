    <h1> Overview</h1>
    <p>
        Sometimes you've got a nice big drawer, and you want to put things in it --- silverware, cooking tools, a
        collection of sewing notions, whatever! --- but
        if you do that, everything will get all jumbled up. You can buy something like this <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0KL7PQ"> Rubbermaid Silverware Tray</a>, but
        that only works for silverware, and only if your silverware is the right size for Rubbermaid's trays. You can go
        to Etsy and pay someone to
        make a custom divider for you -- they'll make a beautiful maple divider for just a few hundred dollars. Or you
        can do it yourself, if you have access to a
        laser cutter and some plywood that's thin enough for the laser-cutter to handle it. Here's one that I made.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
        The pieces in this divider interlock at crossings, and where the end of one pieces meets another, there's either
        a box-joint (at a corner) or a
        tab-and-slot joint (at a mid-piece intersection). You can see that each piece in this example ends at another
        piece, but the divider-making tool
        here allows you to have "free ends" if you really want them. Those are weaker, and more likely to get broken,
        but they're allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also see that all the pieces in this divider are connected, and every vertical piece is connected to a
        horizontal one,
        which helps all the pieces stand up. But you could make a divider consisting of just two cross-wise pieces if
        you wanted. They'd both
        fall over when you put them in your drawer, so it's not a good idea...but it's up to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        You might also notice that the lengthwise pieces in the divider have "dips" in them to make it easier to grab
        things like spoons or knives
        that are stacked up. This tool lets you create those, too, and you get to choose how deep the dips are. If the
        dip is 100%, you'll end up
        with a panel that's broken into multiple panels, so that's a bad idea. Something like 70% of the total height
        seems to work well. You get to
        choose the dip-size for both crosswise and lengthwise panels.
    </p>
    To make things easier (and to match the tool where you'll be drawing the divider you want), I'm going to call panels
    that run from the left-hand
    to the right-hand side of the drawer "horizontal" and those that run from front to back "vertical." I'll call the
    distance from the bottom of the drawer to the
    top of each panel the "height" of the divider. Typical dividers will have dips in the vertical pieces, but not the
    horizontal ones.
    <p>
        The tool gives you a lot of freedom to create whatever design you like, but you have the responsibility of
        making sure that the pieces
        will stand up (because they're connected to perpendicular pieces), and that they'll be strong enough (long
        overhanging pieces are weak!),
        and that the dips aren't too deep.
    </p>
    <p>
        One more note about dips: creating a dip between two joints requires some space: a little bit of room to get
        away from the joint (i.e., to leave material
        for the joint to be strong), room for a curve from horizontal to vertical, and another back to horizontal at the
        bottom of the dip, and then
        the same thing at the other end of the dip. If the two joints are too close to fit all that stuff, no dip gets
        created.
    </p>
    <h1> How you use the tool </h1>
    <p> First, measure your drawer. Suppose it's 14 inches wide and 18 inches deep (yes, everything is in inches; metric
        folks will have to convert). You would enter the width and height as 14 and 18. But wait: you want to be really
        sure that there's an honest
        14 inches of room. If it's even a tiny bit less, your divider won't fit. You might want to use 13.9 inches
        instead. It's up to you, but
        I recommend playing it safe.
    </p>
    <p> There's another thing. Suppose your plywood is a (very beefy) solid 0.25 inch wide. Then the space you laid out
        as 1" wide will only end up as 0.75". Be sure to take that into account.
        And the lost space is taken from the right-most compartment. Suppose you have a 6-inch wide drawer, and you say
        "I'd like 3 slots, each 2 inches." If (again) you're using
        1/4" plywood, then you'll end up with slots of widths 2", 2", and 1.75 inches. Frankly, this usually doesn't
        matter, but if you're obsessed with symmetry, you
        might want to think about it.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p> Now decide how tall you'd like the divider to be. Check that when you make a divider that tall, the drawer will
        still close. A good starting
        point is the height of the side of the drawer, measured on the inside of the drawer. You don't want anything
        taller than that, and you may well want
        something shorter. Try making some cardboard cutouts to get a feel for how awkward it is to reach to the bottom
        of a 3 x 3 inch "pit" that's
        2 inches tall! When you've settled on a height, enter that in the "Height" field of the tool.
